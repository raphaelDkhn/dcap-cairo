# TDX Cairo Verifier [WIP]

A quote verifier for [Intel's TDX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/trust-domain-extensions/overview.html), implemented in Cairo. 
It enables trust-minimized validation of TEE quotes without relying on [attestation authority services](https://docs.trustauthority.intel.com/main/articles/introduction.html).
